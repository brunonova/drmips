## About DrMIPS

DrMIPS is a graphical simulator of the [MIPS][MIPS] processor to support computer 
architecture teaching and learning. It is intuitive, versatile and configurable.

The simulator is available not only for personal computers but also for Android 
devices, especially tablets.

DrMIPS was created under the Master's dissertation entitled 
*Tool to Support Computer Architecture Teaching and Learning* at 
[FEUP][FEUP].

DrMIPS is open-source and licensed under the [GPLv3][gpl3], so you are free to 
use, redistribute, modify and improve it (under certain conditions). Feel free
to [contribute][contribute]!

You can find the download links [below](#download).


### Features

*   Free and open-source
*   Available for both PCs and Android devices
*   Can simulate both unicycle and pipeline versions of the MIPS processor
*   Datapath displayed graphically
*   Step-by-step execution and back step
*   Edit registers and data memory during execution
*   Performance mode, where the latencies are simulated and the critical path of
    the processor is shown
*   Highly configurable datapaths and instruction sets, and additional ones can
    be created
*   Custom components can be created externally and then used by the simulator
    at runtime
*   Fairly intuitive and easy to use
*   Integrated code editor, with syntax highlighting and autocomplete in the PC
    version
*   Values can be displayed either in binary, decimal or hexadecimal
*   Light and dark themes
*   The panes of the simulator can be displayed either as tabs or windows in the
    PC version

### Note on supported instructions

DrMIPS simulates and displays the datapath of the processor graphically.
Therefore, the simulator only supports the instructions that the datapath itself
supports.
Since this is mostly an educational simulator, the provided datapaths are very
simple, and thus **support a rather limited set of instructions**.
Several instructions like `jal`, `jr`, syscalls, floating-point operations
and shifts are not supported.
