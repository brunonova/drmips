## About DrMIPS

DrMIPS is a graphical simulator of the [MIPS][MIPS] processor to support computer 
architecture teaching and learning. It is intuitive, versatile and configurable.

The simulator is available not only for personal computers but also for Android 
devices, especially tablets.

DrMIPS was created under the Master's dissertation entitled 
*Tool to Support Computer Architecture Teaching and Learning* at 
[FEUP][FEUP].

DrMIPS is open-source and licensed under the [GPLv3][gpl3], so you are free to 
use, redistribute, modify and improve it (under certain conditions). Feel free
to contribute!


### Features
