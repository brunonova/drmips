### DrMIPS

DrMIPS is a graphical simulator of the [MIPS][MIPS] processor to support computer 
architecture teaching and learning. It is intuitive, versatile and configurable.

The simulator is available not only for personal computers but also for Android 
devices, especially tablets.

DrMIPS was created under the Master's dissertation entitled 
*Tool to Support Computer Architecture Teaching and Learning* at 
[FEUP][FEUP].

DrMIPS is open-source and licensed under the [GPLv3][gpl3], so you are free to 
use, redistribute, modify and improve it (under certain conditions). Feel free
to contribute!


### Features

*   For both PCs and Android devices
*   Simulate both unicycle and pipeline versions of the MIPS processor
*   Datapath displayed graphically
*   Step-by-step execution and back step
*   Edit registers and data memory during execution
*   Performance mode, where the latencies are simulated and the critical path of
    the processor is shown
*   Highly configurable datapaths and instruction sets, and additional ones can
    be created
*   Fairly intuitive and easy to use
*   Integrated code editor, with syntax highlighting and autocomplete in the PC
    version
*   Display values in binary, decimal or hexadecimal
*   Light and a dark themes
*   Display contents of the simulator as tabs or windows in the PC version
*   Free and open-source
